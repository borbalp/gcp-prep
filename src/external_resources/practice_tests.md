# Practice Tests

The [GCP Google Associate Cloud Engineer Practice Test Exam 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/latest-gcp-ace-google-associate-cloud-engineer-practice-exams-tests) Udemy course offers five sets of 50 questions (with a few extras) in quizzes that closely mirror the structure of the real exam. A significant percentage of these questions have appeared on the real exam, and the rest follow similar themes, making this an excellent resource to build upon hands-on experience and apply it to the exam.

### How to Use the Practice Tests

This heuristic is based on [@borbalp](https://github.com/borbalp)'s success and the observation that the practice exams are often more difficult than the real one. While this general framework is useful, the exact approach and numbers that work best for you may vary.

1. **Assess**: Start by taking one of the practice exams to gauge your current level of understanding and identify areas of weakness.
2. **Review and Study**: After completing a practice test, review the explanations for the questions you've gotten wrong. While the official readme of the course recommends reading the explanations for your correct answers as well, in practice, developing intuition through understanding your mistakes is often more valuable. Since you will be repeating these tests, it's unlikely you will miss any wrong answers, even if you guess correctly initially.
3. **Repeat**: Continue taking the practice exams. Focus on understanding the rationale behind the answers. Some questions will cover obscure concepts that are rarely encountered in the exam or real life. It's fine to not pay much attention to these, as they provide only a negligible net increase in your average score.
4. **Target 85%**: Repeat the practice exams until you can consistently achieve a score of 85% or higher. Regardless of your score, it is recommended to repeat each test at least five times, spread over multiple days, to reinforce your knowledge and ensure retention.
