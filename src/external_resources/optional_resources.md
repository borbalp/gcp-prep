### GCP Associate Cloud Engineer Certification: Google Cloud

This [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-gcp-associate-cloud-engineer-certification) is a 21-hour long video series that covers most of the concepts that appear on the exam. It includes theoretical knowledge and hands-on labs that familiarize you with the GCP software toolkit (Cloud Console, `gcloud` command, `gsutil` command, etc.). While this course may be useful for real-world applications, it takes a long time, and does not significantly help with exam preparation.
